An example and notes on SVM (Support vector machines)

## Notes on SVMs

Great for small data (less than 1000)
Less work than DNN (Deep Neural Network)
Can be used for classifiecation or regression 
With labled data can create discriminative classifier
The data is split by the hyperplane or line
Want to maximize the margin between data points so new data has greastest chance to fall on correct side of line
Hyperplane is of dimension n-1, where n is number of data features
A supervised linear classifier
